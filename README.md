# Gleason-et-al-JAMES-2018

This folder contains the 'as built' code and data for Gleason et al JAMES 2018. The code has not been polished for public release, and a number of hard-coded paths and dependencies will prevent this from running on your machine should you try to download and run straightaway. 

Note also this project was started in 2016, when I was still using Matlab, so a Matlab license is required. 

Finally, the PCR-GLOBWB output are not included here (file too large). Those or similar data can be generated from any global model.
